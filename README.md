# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
The code contains the methodology used to predict house prices in boston using the machine learning technique linear regression. 

Intitally I will be performing exploratodry data analysis, to get insights like, 
1) What features might or might not be affecting the price 
2) How the features are distributed
3) Is there any relation between the features themselves
4) Are there missing values
   
Secondly I will be building a linear regression model along with
1) Checking for multicoliinearity, which mean if there is a correlation between the features we are assuming to be independent
2) How good the model is, how well the model is fitting on the test data

Finally I will be checking linear regression model assumptions.
